It wasn't bad- it's simply just not as good as the other Cirque shows. Nor is it as good as Absynthe or Le Reve. If it is the raunchy stuff you are looking for, see Absynthe. I found every element of Zumanity to just be lacking. It wasn't quite funny enough, wasn't quite sexy enough, wasn't quite acrobatically impressive enough, and the music just wasn't that great. I guess if you have never seen a Cirque show before or have completely sheltered yourself from everyday social issues\\/exposure in 2016, you may be left shocked or impressed but I think most people will find this show to be a let down. I was one of them, especially having paid the same amount I paid to see much more impressive shows.\n","Actual Rating:  3\n","Predicted Rating: 3\n"],"name":"stdout"}]}]}
